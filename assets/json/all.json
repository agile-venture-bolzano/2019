      "description": "In twenty years or so, agile software development went from being a ridiculed exoteric cult to mainstream religion, featuring beliefs and traits typical of both phases.\r\n\r\nSomeone wants more code and less tree hugging, someone else wants more soft skills and less engineering mindset. Someone wants to redeem banks, others crave start-up asceticism. Some are clinging to the Tables of the Manifesto while some other is re-inventing the Wheel® in a desperate attempt to get their place in a market in which it has become tough to differentiate ourselves. We have got all of them!\r\n\r\nSomething is broken in this visceral attachment to the how rather than the what. We shouldn't forget, as much as in true religions, that agile was born with a simple goal: making everybody happier. The problem is that \"simple\" is not \"easy\".\r\n\r\nAnd in software engineering there is no afterlife to get even by.\r\n\r\n",

The multitude of buzzwords used in the field and the many topics that seems to be esoteric (agile HR, agile marketing, digital transformation, and others) are clear signs that we're in the commodification era. A common pattern starts to emerge: agile is nowadays beyond software development. But what happen if nobody talks about software?  Are there implications for the companies landscape at large? Economic and social impacts, maybe? Doesn't seems to early to move agility beyond software development when, we didn't understood the manifesto principle yet? Meanwhile many others seems to have forgotten XP. If we imagine to draw a line in the sand between principles and practices, where is the thin boundary that separate us from the simplest thing in the world: the ability to work in a proper way beyond the working methods.

      "description": "Agile is old. Good and old. The fathers of Agile started experimenting with its principles and practices back in the ‘80s, when the problem they faced was how to provide a software production team with a more sensible way to develop code and deliver actual value to the stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe second wave of Agile, a couple of decades later, was about scaling the production beyond one single team (we are still in that wave).\r\n\r\nThe third wave of Agile, which just recently started and went well beyond the realm of IT alone, finally realized that true agility can only be achieved when: 1) it’s adopted, in context-specific ways, throughout the entire organization and; 2) it includes the way the organization interacts with its market and environment (call it Business Agility or any other similar term).\r\n\r\nWhat we are seeing today in the most innovative organizations, even outside of the IT industry, is that the underlying values and principles of agility are applied with an holistic approach to all organizational functions (finance, marketing, HR, operations, governance, procurement, production and so forth).\r\n\r\nWe also seeing how the organizational structure itself and the style of leadership in these organizations have evolved, to be consistent with the way agility works and delivers on its promises.\r\n\r\nI know quite well from my experience with clients (working with tech teams, design teams, program and project managers, executives, HR, finance) and from helping them to rethink and restructure the way their organization works, that there are many challenges that an organization has to face to make this transition — and many pitfalls as well.\r\n\r\nAmong the different challenges (learning new skills and practices, descaling processes, decentralizing decision making and accepting inherent uncertainty, just to name a few) one that is often overlooked is how to change the perception of the organization itself, so that it can become a 21st-century, adaptive organization. \r\n\r\nIn fact, while “traditional” organizations revolved mainly around production — and were therefore perceived through that set of lenses — adaptive organizations include continuous organizational learning and high-efficiency collaboration as part of their operational DNA and of their long-term sustainability and success.\r\n\r\nTherefore, one critical question is: how can we help people shifting their perception of “what needs to be done” considering three different but interrelated dimensions? And what are the practical implications of this?\r\n\r\nIn this session I’m going to share some of the lessons I’ve learned while helping companies to rethink themselves. I’m not going to provide recipes or instructions (I don’t believe those can be replicated in a different context). Rather, I’d like to share the challenges that we encountered and talk about how the way we faced them helped the organization to grow into an adaptive one. \r\n\r\nI’d also like to provide food for thought that might, hopefully, help executives, managers and leaders move in the direction of agility with a clearer sense of direction and with more realistic expectations.\r\n",

I had the opportunity to work with Java and PHP too. I am experimenting with Haskell, Scala and Elm.\r\n\r\nI try to focus more on concepts and practices than on the technology or programming languages. I say this because I think great software is created first with a solid foundation of practices to reduce stress that enable you to maintain the software like tests, code refactoring, continuous integration, clean code.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion good software development is about people, so I embrace and truly believe it’s essential to have a tight collaboration and effective communication between the team and the customer.\r\n",

I help those people working together in better ways because that’s a big chunk of our lives. \r\n\r\nI wrote a few books: “Pro PHP Refactoring”, a TDD chapter in “PHP Best Practices” and “Extreme Contracts” in 2017, on contracts and negotiation in knowledge work. I also contributed to a couple of books written by Jurgen Appelo.\r\n\r\nI am among the founders of ALE Agile Lean Europe network, PHP User Group Roma and Arduino User Group Roma.\r\n\r\nI’ve got a sailing license because of the sea, a glider pilot license because of the sky and I am an LSP facilitator certified by Lucio Margulis.",
